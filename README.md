ArticulateAI is a powerful tool that utilizes the Whisper API for speech transcription. It leverages the advanced capabilities of OpenAI's GPT-3 or GPT-4 (depending on the size of the transcription) to provide intelligent responses. Additionally, Elevenlabs' text-to-speech technology is employed for high-quality audio output.
